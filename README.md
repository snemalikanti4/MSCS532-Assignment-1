# MSCS532 Assignment 1 – Insertion Sort (Decreasing Order)
# Overview

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Insertion Sort algorithm, adapted to sort an array in monotonically decreasing order. The algorithm is based on Chapter 2 of Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS) and demonstrates a clear understanding of sorting logic, control structures, and in-place array manipulation.

The project also showcases proper use of Git version control through multiple commits that document the development process.

# Assignment Objectives

Implement the Insertion Sort algorithm in Python

Modify the algorithm to sort values in monotonically decreasing order

Practice version control with at least three commits

Publish the project in a public GitHub repository

# Technologies Used

Python 3

Git & GitHub

⚙️ How the Algorithm Works

Insertion Sort builds the final sorted list one element at a time.
In this implementation:

Each element is compared with those before it

Elements smaller than the current value are shifted right

The current value is inserted into its correct position

The comparison logic is reversed to ensure decreasing order

▶️ Sample Input and Output
Original Array
[25, 17, 31, 13, 2, 89, 54]

Sorted Array (Monotonically Decreasing Order)
[89, 54, 31, 25, 17, 13, 2]
